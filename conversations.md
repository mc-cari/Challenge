Why I am receiving an UnvoundLocalError on the following code:  def calculate_rebalance_plan(self) -> Dict[str, float]:
    portfolio_value = self.calculate_portfolio_value()
    rebalance_plan: Dict[str, float] = defaultdict(float)
    current_stock_allocation: Dict[str, float]

    for stock_name in self.shares_owned_per_stock:
      stock = self.stocks_available[stock_name]
      stock_weight = self.calculate_current_stock_weight(stock, portfolio_value)
      current_stock_allocation[stock.get_name()] = stock_weight

Looking at your code, the issue is that you're declaring current_stock_allocation as a type annotation but never initializing it as an actual dictionary object.

In this line:

You're only providing a type hint, but you're not creating the actual dictionary. When you try to assign values to it later:

Python raises an UnboundLocalError because current_stock_allocation doesn't reference an actual dictionary object.

Let me fix this for you:

portfolio.py+1-1
The fix is simple: change current_stock_allocation: Dict[str, float] to current_stock_allocation: Dict[str, float] = {} to actually initialize it as an empty dictionary.

The difference is:

current_stock_allocation: Dict[str, float] - This is just a type annotation, no object is created
current_stock_allocation: Dict[str, float] = {} - This creates an actual empty dictionary with the type annotation
Now your code should work without the UnboundLocalError.

Create a test for the Portfolio class, given the input and expected outputs disclosed in @portfolio.py/95-132

I'll scan portfolio.py, stock.py, and utils.py to understand Portfolio's behavior and the example values, then add a pytest test file that uses the disclosed inputs and expected outputs.
I'll add a pytest test file using the example data in portfolio.py to assert the rebalance results and portfolio value invariance.
I created a pytest test tests/test_portfolio.py using the example from portfolio.py, validating the rebalance plan, portfolio value invariance, and final holdings. I'll check for any linter issues in the new test file.
Created tests/test_portfolio.py to assert:
rebalance plan equals META: -1.0, ORCL: -1.16, PLTR: 0.9714285714285714
portfolio value is preserved after applying rebalance
final holdings match {'PLTR': 0.9714285, 'ORCL': 0.34}
Run with:

```bash
pytest
```

Now create a simple web app to display a portfolio, where given some avaliable stocks, an user can see current stocks owned, current stock allocation, get a rebalance plan showing which stocks need to be sold and bought, and apply the rebalance_plan. For testing purposes, the user should also be able to change the price of stocks and change stock allocation

I'll set up a minimal Flask app with templates, add a dependency to `requirements.txt`, and wire endpoints to view/update prices and allocations, calculate/apply the rebalance plan using your existing `Portfolio` and `Stock`.

[1 tool called]

I'll add todos for building the Flask app, then implement them by updating `requirements.txt`, creating `app.py`, and adding a template to render and edit the portfolio, allocations, and prices.

[1 tool called]

I'll update `requirements.txt` to add Flask, then create `app.py` and a `templates/index.html` to implement the web app with routes for viewing/updating prices and allocations, calculating the rebalance plan, and applying it.

[6 tools called]

- I added a minimal Flask app `app.py` with routes to view/update prices and allocations, calculate a rebalance plan, and apply it using your existing `Portfolio` and `Stock`. A simple UI is included in `templates/index.html`. I also added `Flask==3.0.3` to `requirements.txt`.

Run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python /home/mc_cari/fintual/app.py
```

Open `http://localhost:5000` to:
- View owned shares, current per-stock allocation, and portfolio value.
- Update a stockâ€™s price.
- Edit target allocation (0..1 or 0..100; validated to sum to 1).
- Calculate and apply the rebalance plan.

Note:
- State is in-memory for demo purposes.
- Allocation updates are validated by `Portfolio.verify_allocated_stock_total_percentage`.
